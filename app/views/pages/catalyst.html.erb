            <p>Long before we agree to work with an individual, they are rigorously evaluated and
              categorized with our time tested process. We are selective as to whom we chose to
              work with as we understand our partners time is limited and their needs specific.
            </p>
            <p>How can we do this? It isn't
              easy, but we only work with a specific caliber of individual. Whom you ask? People that
              get it done! They are referred to by many names, 'change agent',
              'A players', 'innovators', 'creators', 'doers' and 'leaders'. The people we work with
              are the professional catalysts who can and will take a company from good to great.
              Whether it be a senior role IT role, a Leadership position or any other strategic need within your
              company, you owe it to your organization to bring in the best talent, and that is who we
              specialize in identifying, working with and placing.
